title: "Trading options: Guiding principles"

In this post we discuss three principles of trading which everyone knows but which everyone under-implements:

1. Capital efficiency,
2. Diversification,
3. Opportunism.

CDO for short. Yes, I acknowledge the irony.

This is part of a series discussing our intended options trading strategies.

### Capital efficiency

If you think you have a winning strategy - which you should, otherwise, stop trading now - you should use _all of your capital_ to implement it. 

Naively, this sounds like we are pressuring you to seek greater returns at the cost of adopting extra risk. However, it's almost the opposite, or at the very least, not that simple. Capital should be viewed as a tool for not only earning returns, but managing risk while preserving the same (absolute) returns. 

For example, in the context of selling puts, using all of your capital is the difference between 

1. selling a single at-the-money put, and 
2. selling several deep out-of-the-money puts on a diverse collection of underlying stocks.

One has almost a 50% chance of ending poorly, while the other has a vanishingly small chance of ending poorly.

### Diversification

Diversify. Keep in mind that there are many ways to diversify, and you should use all of them. Here is a sample list:

1. Trade in many different stocks.
2. Open both bullish and bearish trades.
3. Sell options with many different expirations.
4. Place your orders at different times, rather than all at once.

### Opportunism

There are many different stocks, most of which remain listed for many years. You are not compelled to trade any one of them, at any particular time. You should use this freedom to your advantage: Save your aggressive trading for when you see blatant inefficiencies.

Food for thought: Stock pickers should _research_; options traders should _explore_. Stock picking profits from _private_ information and knowledge. Options trading profits from _public_ fear and exuberance.
