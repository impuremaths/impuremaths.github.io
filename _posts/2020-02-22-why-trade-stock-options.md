title: "Why trade stock options?"
---

I can think of three reasons to trade stock options:

1. To exploit psychological inefficiencies, including rare-event overestimation and risk non-neutrality,
2. To exploit inefficiencies in accepted market regulations, including lending requirements and short-inaccessibility,
3. To profit from diversification by converting it into a tangible financial asset.

### Psychological inefficiencies

In principle, options contracts should be priced at their expected value. However, they are often priced higher due to psychological inefficiencies.

One often cited metaphor is that the options market is a casino, where sellers collectively form the house, while buyers form the gamblers. This is what I refer to as rare-event overestimation: Gamblers typically overestimate the likelihood of hitting jackpots, and will overpay for options contracts.

A second often-cited metaphor is that the options market is an insurance market, which exists due to risk non-neutrality, and typically, risk aversion. Since most investors are presumed to be risk-averse, they likely are willing to overpay for options contracts which reduce their risk, independent of the expected value of the contract.

### Market inefficiences

In an ideal market, money should be lent freely: Traders should be able to access as much capital as they wish. However, this is not the case.

For instance, margin regulations prevent brokers from allowing more than 2x leverage. As a result, traders are pushed toward options markets as the only means to leverage beyond a certain level. This crowds the options market and raises contract prices.

Similarly, retail investors typically do not have easy access to short trades. The supply of put options is thus artificially squeezed.

### Valuing diversification

You might be a typical investor with a typical risk-averse profile. In that case, you would be just as willing to buy an option as to sell one, and so you may as well do neither. However, diversification is an alternative means by which to reduce risk. 

The options market may be viewed as one tangible way to monetize the effort and capital required to diversify your financial portfolio.
