<div class="media">
  <p>You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you wonâ€™t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!</p>

I have always wanted to understand the "Feynman license plate fallacy" deeply and precisely. We will explore this in today's post.

### A list of thought experiments

To understand the FLP fallacy, I think it will be helpful to list a number of other thought experiments often drawn for comparison.

1. Observing the license plate AAA 000.
2. Winning the lottery.
3. Having life on Earth.
4. Flipping a coin five times and then telling someone the resulting sequence.
5. Telling someone a coin flip sequence and then flipping it.
