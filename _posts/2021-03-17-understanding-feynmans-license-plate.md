title: "Understanding Feynman's license plate"

<div class="media">
  <p>You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you wonâ€™t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!</p>

I have always wanted to understand the "Feynman license plate fallacy" deeply and precisely. We will explore this in today's post.

### A list of thought experiments

To understand the FLP fallacy, it will be helpful to list a number of other thought experiments often drawn for comparison:

1. Observing the license plate AAA 000.
2. Winning the lottery.
3. The hospitality of Earth toward life.
4. Flipping a coin five times and then telling someone the resulting sequence.
5. Telling someone a squence of five coin flips and then flipping it.
6. Conducting either of the two previous scenarios with the sequence HHHHH.

### Strings and plants

The fundamental question posed by the FLP fallacy is: When is someone pulling the strings? When is it reasonable to suspect that a willful agent has planted the coins and dice governing what you have witnessed?

We can divide the list of thought experiments as follows. Fallacious suspicion:

0. Feynman's license plate ARW 357.
2. Winning the lottery.
4. Flipping and then reporting.

On the other hand, suspicion is warranted in the remaining scenarios:

1. The license plate AAA 000.
5. Staking a sequence and then flipping it.
6. The sequence HHHHH, regardless.

(Let's put off 3 for now.) How can we best understand these groupings?
