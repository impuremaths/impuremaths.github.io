title: "Order execution III: Public exchange data and best execution"
---

We continue our series on [order execution]({{ "" | relative_url }}{% post_url 2021-02-24-order-execution %}). In this post, we seek to better understand the sense in which brokers are required to obtain the best available prices for their customers. We saw in [Part I]({{ "" | relative_url }}{% post_url 2021-02-24-order-execution %}) and [Part II]({{ "" | relative_url }}{% post_url 2021-02-27-order-execution-ii %}) that brokers have a few options to choose from when executing a customer's order. 

Recall I started this series by noting the large amount of misinformation on the subject, especially with the recent GME phenomenon. Accordingly, the more research I do, the less sinister the industry seems to be. Regulation stipulates that brokers must serve their customers with the best possible execution. On the other hand, sources imply that this is taken to be a figurative requirement. To determine who is right, we need to get into the weeds.

### Public exchange data

When you research the price and volume of AAPL stock from publicly available data, what is the source of that data? This is not obvious, now that we are aware that stock transactions may occur off of a centralized exchange.
